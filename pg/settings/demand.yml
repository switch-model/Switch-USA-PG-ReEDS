# LOAD GROWTH ASSUMPTIONS
#

# Normal PG approach is to apply year-to-year growth rates from a particular AEO
# edition and scenario (specified at the top) to historical hourly load shapes
# (defined further down). The region_maps are used to map study regions to AEO
# regions (before/after 2019) for this purpose. If the region maps aren't right
# (e.g., don't match model_regions defined elsewhere), no growth will be
# applied, which can be problematic with historical load profiles from well
# before the start of the study.


# User load profiles in regional_load_fn are applied as-is (no growth factor)
# and supersede any loads defined below. They should have three header rows
# identifying model year, scenario and region, then one row per historical hour
# (same number of rows as the renewable resource data). For 2025-2030, we use
# unchanging 2023 loads based on 2007-2013 weather years, extracted from
# load_curves_nrel_reeds table in pg_db by make_study_loads.py. Then we apply
# ICF 2025-35 growth rates to that for 2024-2030 and report this growth as
# flexible demand (in flexible_load.yml)
regional_load_fn: reeds_2023_loads.csv.zip

# name of current demand scenario; should match entries in the second row of
# headers of `regional_load_fn`
electrification: base

# note: we also add growth in via flexible_load.yml, so it can optionally be
# made interruptible.


# # The ReEDS dataset (load_curves_nrel_reeds table in PG_DB) includes hourly
# # demand from 2007-2013, shifted to 2020-2050. In this case, since model years
# # appear in the PG_DB dataset, data for model years will be used as-is, with no
# # growth applied. If the model year is not included in the dataset (e.g., the
# # load shapes used for the MIP study), PG will pull all years from the load
# # source table, then grow them to the future model year. The growth rates from
# # 2012-2019 can be calculated using historical data (from EIA AEO). Different
# # growth scenarios can be selected using the same AEO scenarios used for fuel
# # prices. Examples include HIGHMACRO for high growth and LOWMACRO for low
# # growth. 
# regular_load_growth_start_year: 2020
# growth_scenario: REF2021

# # Historical load profiles from load sources
# # will use load_aeo_year or 2020 if not specified
# load_eia_aeo_year: 2021

# # *_load_region_map entries identify model regions that fall in each 
# # AEO region. `historical_load_region_map` is used prior to 2019 and 
# # `future_load_region_map` is used after. Annual % growth rates are 
# # taken from the `growth_scenario` and aeo release specified above.

# Historical hourly load profiles
######################

# PG needs profiles for each fine-scale model region. They will be concatenated
# from all the tables listed under `load_source_table_name`, which will be read
# from the pg_db database, and from user-supplied profiles in
# `regional_load_fn`. Not clear what happens if the same region appears more
# than once among these sources.
load_source_table_name: ~
  # load_source: table_name
  # reeds: load_curves_nrel_reeds

# regional_load_source should be either a name of a single load_source to use
# for all regions or a dictionary of `load_source: [model_region1,
# model_region2]` entries. Profiles will only be constructed for sources and
# regions identified here. Specify USER as the load_source for regions that
# should be pulled from regional_load_fn.
