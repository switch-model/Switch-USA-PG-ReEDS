# Flexible loads associated with increased electrification can be included using data
# from NREL's EFS study (described below) or using user input files. This case study
# uses EFS data.


# Electrification scenarios are supplied in two files. EFS_STOCK_AGG.parquet has scenarios
# from the NREL Electrification Futures Study (EFS). SCENARIO_STOCK.parquet has scenarios
# from the Princeton Net Zero study. The scenario name will depend on which source you
# use. The NREL EFS scenarios include:

# HIGH ELECTRIFICATION - MODERATE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT
# MEDIUM ELECTRIFICATION - MODERATE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT
# REFERENCE ELECTRIFICATION - MODERATE TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT

# The Princeton Net Zero scenarios include:

# current_policy
# stated_policy
# deep_decarbonization
# moderate_decarbonization

# The type of flexible loads that can be included as flexible demand resources (with hourly
# profiles from NREL EFS data) are:

# res_space_heat_cool (residential space heating and cooling)
# res_water_heat (residential water heating)
# comm_space_heat_cool (commercial space heating and cooling)
# comm_water_heat (commercial water heating)
# trans_light_duty (light duty vehicles)
# trans_medium_duty (medium duty vehicles)
# trans_heavy_duty (heavy duty vehicles)
# trans_bus (transit buses)

# Demand Response (flexible load) info
##########################

# Demand response profiles for the current scenario (identified in
# `demand_response`) will be added to loads for the specified region and model
# year if the scenario matches the `demand_response` setting above. They will
# also be used to define dummy generators for flexible demand based on entries
# in `flexible_demand_resources` (if `demand_response_fn` is defined,
# `demand_response` and `flexible_demand_resources` must be too).

# Table 5.1 from the NREL report "Electrification Futures Study: Scenarios of
# Electric Technology Adoption and Power Consumption for the United States" can
# serve as a starting point for determining parameter values.

# name of current demand response scenario, read by
# make_demand_response_profiles
demand_response: base


# csv file with hourly profiles for demand response resources in each
# region/year/scenario. The top four rows are 
#   1) the name of the DR resource (matching key values in
#      `flexible_demand_resources` below), 
#   2) the model year, 
#   3) the scenario name (scenarios are selected using the `demand_response`
#      settings parameter), and
#   4) the model region from `model_regions`
# Then the rows contain hourly loads for each of these cases / regions. There should be 
# one row per load hour, in order, with no explicit index.
demand_response_fn: load_adjustments.csv.zip

# `flexible_demand_resources` contains name of the flexible resource, fraction of
# load that can be shifted, and model-specific parameters that will be applied
# to each resource.

# PowerGenome will create virtual generators (resources) with the following
# params:
#   - Existing_Cap_MW: fraction_shiftable (from here) * profile.max()
#   - New_Build: -1  # always overridden by New_Build tag in resource_tags.yml
#   - Fuel: "No_fuel"
#   - cluster: 1
#   - others as given under `parameter_values` here
# They will also have max cap factor equal to the normalized load shape, so 
# effectively they can represent curtailment of fraction_shiftable * profile
# in any hour (subject to limits imposed by the model based on parameter_values).

# Note: profile for the capacity calculation will come from `demand_response_fn`
# if defined, otherwise `electrification_stock_fn` (defined elsewhere).

# Note: any resource type defined here must also be set to FLEX = 1 and
# New_Build = -1 in resource_tags.yml > model_tag_values (if FLEX=1 is only set
# here, it will be reset to 0 there; PowerGenome always sets New_Build to -1,
# but then it gets reset to 0 there)

# note: also set resource_tags.yml > model_tag_values:
# gen_max_annual_availability: 0.0 (or whatever) We could in theory set that
# under flexible_demand_resources: year: resource: parameter_values:
# gen_max_annual_availability: but then all the other gens get 0.0 assigned as
# the default value, which we don't want; on the other hand, if we set a default
# value in model_tag_values, then that overrides whatever we try to set here.

      # parameter_values empty causes PG warnings)
