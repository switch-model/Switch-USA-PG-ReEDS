# EIA AEO FUEL PRICE VARIABLES

# Which year of AEO to use. Note that different years have different scenario names
# so those may need to be modified accordingly.
fuel_eia_aeo_year: 2025
aeo_fuel_usd_year: 2024

# FUEL SCENARIOS
# These parameters map the EIA scenario names to user names (e.g. reference is used inplace
# of REF2020 and low_resource in place of LOWOGS), and EIA fuel codes to user fuel names
# (e.g. coal in place of STC). Each user fuel name is then assigned a user scenario name.

# This is a subset of AEO 2020 scenarios. For a full list, look at the eia open data
# page https://www.eia.gov/opendata/qb.php?category=3604304
eia_series_scenario_names:
  reference: REF2025 # Includes 111(d) policy that retires nearly all coal plants -- leads to very low coal prices
  no_111d: nocaa111 # No 111(d) policy that would retire coal plants
  low_price: LOWPRICE # Low oil price scenario
  high_price: HIGHPRICE # High oil price scenario
  high_resource: HIGHOGS # High oil and gas resource scenario -- lowest gas prices
  low_resource: LOWOGS # Low oil and gas resource scenario -- highest gas prices

# Need to make choices about fuel regions when user-defined regions cross AEO fuel regions.
# Regions are included here only as a guide. All user regions must be mapped to AEO regions.
