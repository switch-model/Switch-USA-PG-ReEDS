# - ReEDS info for RGGI
# - CA, NY and WA are given a 0 cap to create a simple carbon tax
# TODO: check whether the ReEDS version of RGGI corresponds to the basic allocation
# or basic + cost containment reserve and decide which we'd rather use (may depend on
# how high our CO2 shadow price ends up)
# Also see carbon_cost_dollar_per_tco2 for the single carbon tax price, also used as
# escape price for all CO2 policies.

# original version (network_costs_ReEDS.csv) matches reeds_ba_tx_NARIS2024_avg.csv
# but we use reeds_ba_tx_REFS2009_avg.csv, which has some additional lines that
# get dropped because of this, so we use a quick-patched version (dump in the 
# missing lines and assign average params to them)
user_transmission_costs: network_costs_ReEDS_patched_for_REFS2009.csv
# the reeds_ba_tx_NARIS_avg data don't have enough transmission to serve p119
# during certain timepoints in a 2024 model, so we use REFS2009 instead. see
# cryptic documentation at
# https://github.com/NREL/ReEDS-2.0/blob/main/sources_documentation.md
# Note: NARIS says p119 has 972 MW outbound to p122 and 171 inbound; REFS2009
# says it has 2530 MW either way. Inspection of OpenInfraMap data gives an
# estimate around 4600 MVA (assuming 1000 A per line).
